#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document containing the elements.

elementsToCheckout
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic ISet   [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The ids of the elements to attempt to check out.

options
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB TransactWithCentralOptions](f5da22fa-55ee-9196-cafd-5323d8e9ca0a.htm)    
     Options to customize access to the central model.    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  is allowed and means no customization.

#### Return Value

The ids of all specified elements that are now owned (but possibly out of date), including all that were owned prior to the function call.

# Remarks

For best performance, checkout all elements in one big call, rather than many small calls.

Revit may check out additional elements that are needed to check out the elements you requested. For example, if you request an element that is in a group, Revit will check out the entire group.
