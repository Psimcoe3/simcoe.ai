  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static StairsRun CreateStraightRun( 	Document document, 	ElementId stairsId, 	Line locationPath, 	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateStraightRun ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	stairsId As ElementId, _ 	locationPath As Line, _ 	justification As StairsRunJustification _ ) As StairsRun ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static StairsRun^ CreateStraightRun( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ stairsId,  	Line^ locationPath,  	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

stairsId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The stairs that the new stairs run will belong to.

locationPath
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.htm)    
     The line for location path of the new stairs run. The line has following restriction:

    * The line should be bound line which is parallel to the XY plane.
    * The Z coordinate of the line is the base elevation for the new run (in model coordinates). It must be greater than or equal to the stairs base elevation.
    * The number of created risers will be calculated by rounding the length of the location path to a multiple of the tread depth.

justification
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture StairsRunJustification](4d75bda7-267b-dc0e-286a-b5efb839655f.htm)    
     The location path justification of the new stairs run.

#### Return Value

The new stairs run.

# Remarks

The new stairs run and the document will be regenerated. This should be run from within an open transaction.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The stairsId is not a valid stairs element. -or- The input locationPath is not a bound line. -or- The input locationPath is not a valid location path line for straight run. -or- The locationPath is not valid line used as stairs path(probably it's too short). |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | A value passed for an enumeration argument is not a member of that enumeration |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The stairs element represented by stairsId is not in an active StairsEditScope. New components cannot be added to it. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.htm) | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.htm) | The document has no open transaction. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.htm) | The locationPath doesn't satisfy restrictions to generate straight run. |
