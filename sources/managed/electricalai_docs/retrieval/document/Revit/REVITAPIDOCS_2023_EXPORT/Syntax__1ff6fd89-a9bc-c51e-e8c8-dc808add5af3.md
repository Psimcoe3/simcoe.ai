**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2022.1

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void SplitSegment( 	int segmentIndex, 	IList<double> segmentHeights ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub SplitSegment ( _ 	segmentIndex As Integer, _ 	segmentHeights As IList(Of Double) _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void SplitSegment( 	int segmentIndex,  	IList<double>^ segmentHeights ) ``` |

#### Parameters

segmentIndex
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The index of segment, starting with 0.

segmentHeights
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   Double    
     An array contains the height for each new segment except the last segment. The height of the last segment will be determined by the height of previous new segments and the height of the split segment.

# Remarks

The height values are used to set the height of schedule instance for each segment shown on sheet view. Each input height must be greater than 0 and the total height must be less than the height of the split segment.
