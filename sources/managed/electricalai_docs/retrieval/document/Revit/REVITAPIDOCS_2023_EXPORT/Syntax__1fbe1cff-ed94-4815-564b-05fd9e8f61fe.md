A filter used to match elements with a bounding box that intersects the given Outline.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2011

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter : ElementQuickFilter ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter _ 	Inherits ElementQuickFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter : public ElementQuickFilter ``` |

# Remarks

This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType. This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory.

```
// Use BoundingBoxIntersects filter to find elements with a bounding box that intersects the 
// given Outline in the document. 

// Create a Outline, uses a minimum and maximum XYZ point to initialize the outline. 
Outline myOutLn = new Outline(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), new XYZ(100, 100, 100));

// Create a BoundingBoxIntersects filter with this Outline
BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter filter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn);

// Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
// This filter excludes all objects derived from View and objects derived from ElementType
FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> elements = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();


// Find all walls which don't intersect with BoundingBox: use an inverted filter to match elements
// Use shortcut command OfClass() to find walls only
BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter invertFilter = new BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter(myOutLn, true); // inverted filter
collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> notIntersectWalls =
    collector.OfClass(typeof(Wall)).WherePasses(invertFilter).ToElements();
```
