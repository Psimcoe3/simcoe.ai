#### NewFamilyInstance Method (Face, Line, FamilySymbol)

---



|  |
| --- |
| [ItemFactoryBase Class](cba2c84a-22c0-e6e7-a99c-67656901853a.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Inserts a new instance of a family onto a face of an existing element, using a line on that face for its position, and a type/symbol.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance( 	Face face, 	Line position, 	FamilySymbol symbol ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewFamilyInstance ( _ 	face As Face, _ 	position As Line, _ 	symbol As FamilySymbol _ ) As FamilyInstance ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FamilyInstance^ NewFamilyInstance( 	Face^ face,  	Line^ position,  	FamilySymbol^ symbol ) ``` |

#### Parameters

face
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)    
     A face of a geometry object.

position
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.htm)    
     A line on the face defining where the symbol is to be placed.

symbol
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)    
     A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted. Note that this symbol must represent a family whose  [FamilyPlacementType](7fcd2fda-21c3-9b9b-8ef3-ae2e53e02a05.htm)  is WorkPlaneBased or CurveBased.

#### Return Value

An instance of the new object if creation was successful, otherwise    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

# Remarks

Use this method to insert one family instance on a face of another element, using a line on the face to define the position and direction of the new symbol.

The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.

The host object must support insertion of instances, otherwise this method will fail. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown.

Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | Thrown when a non-optional argument was null. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | Thrown when the function cannot get the Reference from the face, or, Family cannot be placed as line-based on an input face reference, because its FamilyPlacementType is not WorkPlaneBased or CurveBased |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.htm) | Thrown when the family cannot be placed on this line as it does not coincide with the input face. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Thrown when Revit is unable to place the family instance. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | Thrown if The symbol is not active. |
