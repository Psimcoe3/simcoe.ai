| [RevolvedSurface Class](ce0b47e0-2b24-61f5-1434-87fe3ff70390.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a Surface object coincident with the surface of revolution defined by an axis, a profile curve, and start and end angles of revolution.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static Surface Create( 	XYZ axisBasePoint, 	XYZ axisDirection, 	Curve profileCurve, 	double startAngle, 	double endAngle ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	axisBasePoint As XYZ, _ 	axisDirection As XYZ, _ 	profileCurve As Curve, _ 	startAngle As Double, _ 	endAngle As Double _ ) As Surface ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static Surface^ Create( 	XYZ^ axisBasePoint,  	XYZ^ axisDirection,  	Curve^ profileCurve,  	double startAngle,  	double endAngle ) ``` |

#### Parameters

axisBasePoint
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The base point of the axis of revolution. Expected to lie within the Revit design limits  [IsWithinLengthLimits(XYZ)](ac2171af-4250-8a30-faa7-4d7030d29a03.htm)  .

axisDirection
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The direction of the axis.

profileCurve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The profile curve, which should satisfy the following conditions:

    * It is bounded and non-degenerate.
    * It is co-planar with the axis of revolution.
    * It lies on only one side of the axis.
    * Only the end points of the profile curve can touch the axis.

startAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     Start angle of rotation. The angles are measured around the axis of revolution, using the right-hand rule. The profile curve is at the zero angle.

endAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     End angle of rotation. Start angle must be less than end angle and their difference must be less than or equal to two times PI.

#### Return Value

The created surface. Note that this surface may not be of type RevolvedSurface.

# Remarks

The returned surface may not be of type RevolvedSurface - this function will create a surface of the simplest possible type (Plane, Cylinder, etc.) that can be used to represent the required surface of revolution. Given that the surface may be simplified, this function does not guarantee any particular parameterization of the surface.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The input point lies outside of Revit design limits. -or- The input profile curve is not valid to create a surface revolution around the given axis. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | axisDirection has zero length. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.htm) | Start angle must be less than end angle and their difference must be less than or equal to two times PI. |
