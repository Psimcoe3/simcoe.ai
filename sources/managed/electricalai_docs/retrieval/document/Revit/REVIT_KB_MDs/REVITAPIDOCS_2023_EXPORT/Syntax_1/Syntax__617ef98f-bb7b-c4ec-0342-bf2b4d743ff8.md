| ``` Public Shared Function CreateSketchedRunWithSlopeData ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	stairsId As ElementId, _ 	baseElevation As Double, _ 	boundaryCurves As IList(Of SketchedStairsCurveData), _ 	riserCurves As IList(Of Curve), _ 	stairsPath As IList(Of Curve) _ ) As StairsRun ``` |

| ``` public: static StairsRun^ CreateSketchedRunWithSlopeData( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ stairsId,  	double baseElevation,  	IList<SketchedStairsCurveData^>^ boundaryCurves,  	IList<Curve^>^ riserCurves,  	IList<Curve^>^ stairsPath ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

stairsId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The stairs that the new stairs run will belong to.

baseElevation
:   Type:  System Double    
     Base elevation of the new stairs run. It has following restrictions:

    * The base elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs.
    * The base elevation will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.

boundaryCurves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [SketchedStairsCurveData](db3920d1-6efe-0ed4-f951-4d69c254cc6c.htm)    
     The boundary curves of the new stairs run, specifying slope type and height. The curves have following restriction:

    * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
    * The curves should be a pair of curve chains(two sets of curves which connect end-to-end to form the left and right boundaries).
    * The left and right boundary chain curves should not connect to each other.
    * They can be single curves or multi-segmented curves(for example, straight lines and arcs connected).

riserCurves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The riser curves of the new stairs run. The curves have following restriction:

    * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
    * The curves should be able to make at least two curve chains.
    * The curves in each chain should connect between the left and right boundaries.

stairsPath
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The stair path curves of the new stairs run. The curves have following restriction:

    * The curves should consist of bound Line or Arc curves only.
    * The curves should be able to make one curve chain.
    * The curve chain should have intersection with all riser curve chains.
    * The curves should connect between the first and last riser chain curves.

#### Return Value

The new stairs run.

# Remarks

The run type of the new stairs run will be determined by the specified stairs. The new stairs run and the document will be regenerated. This should be run from within an open transaction.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The stairsId is not a valid stairs element. -or- The input riserCurves is empty. -or- The input stairsPath is empty. -or- The input boundaryCurves is empty. The input boundaryCurves contains at least one curve which is not a bound Line or bound Arc and is not supported for this operation. -or- The input riserCurves contains at least one curve which is not a bound Line or bound Arc and is not supported for this operation. -or- The input stairsPath contains at least one curve which is not a bound Line or bound Arc and is not supported for this operation. -or- The riserCurves or boundaryCurves or stairsPath don't meet restrictions to create sketch run. -or- The boundaryCurves has invalid curve used as sketch boundary curve. -or- The riserCurves has invalid curve used as sketch riser curve. -or- The stairsPath has invalid curve used as sketch stairspath curve. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | The given value for baseElevation must be no more than 30000 feet in absolute value. -or- The baseElevation doesn't meet the restriction that bottom of run should not be lower than bottom of stairs. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The stairs element represented by stairsId is not in an active StairsEditScope. New components cannot be added to it. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.htm) | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.htm) | The document has no open transaction. |
