Creates a new duct that connects to two connectors.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical](0eafd899-5912-56fd-94b1-d286156e26fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static Duct Create( 	Document document, 	ElementId ductTypeId, 	ElementId levelId, 	Connector startConnector, 	Connector endConnector ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	ductTypeId As ElementId, _ 	levelId As ElementId, _ 	startConnector As Connector, _ 	endConnector As Connector _ ) As Duct ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static Duct^ Create( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ ductTypeId,  	ElementId^ levelId,  	Connector^ startConnector,  	Connector^ endConnector ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

ductTypeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The ElementId of the new duct type.

levelId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The level ElementId for the new duct.

startConnector
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The first connector where the new duct starts.

endConnector
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The second point of the new duct.

#### Return Value

The created duct.

# Remarks

The new duct will have the same diameter and system type as the start connector. The creation will also connect the new duct to two component who owns the specified connectors. If necessary, additional fitting(s) are included to make a valid connection. If the new duct can not be connected to the next component (e.g., mismatched direction, no valid fitting, and etc), the new duct will still be created at the specified connector position, and an InvalidOperationException is thrown.
